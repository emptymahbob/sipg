# SIPG v2.0.2 Release Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Release Goal
Fix CLI argument parsing issues that prevented users from using complex Shodan queries with spaces and special characters.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. **Fixed Core Issue**
- **Problem**: `sipg search "ssl:"Uber Technologies Inc""` was failing with "Got unexpected extra arguments"
- **Root Cause**: CLI was using `nargs=-1` which split quoted strings into multiple arguments

- **Result**: âœ… All complex queries now work perfectly

### 2. **Updated Documentation**
- Fixed all examples in CLI help text
- Updated `examples` command output

  - `CHANGELOG.md`

### 4. **Testing**
