# SIPG v2.0.2 Release Summary

## 🎯 Release Goal
Fix CLI argument parsing issues that prevented users from using complex Shodan queries with spaces and special characters.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Fixed Core Issue**
- **Problem**: `sipg search "ssl:"Uber Technologies Inc""` was failing with "Got unexpected extra arguments"
- **Root Cause**: CLI was using `nargs=-1` which split quoted strings into multiple arguments
- **Solution**: Changed to `type=str` to handle entire query as single string
- **Result**: ✅ All complex queries now work perfectly

### 2. **Updated Documentation**
- Fixed all examples in CLI help text
- Updated `examples` command output
- Corrected main CLI docstring
- Updated version numbers across all files

### 3. **Version Management**
- Updated version to 2.0.2 in:
  - `sipg/__init__.py`
  - `sipg/cli.py` (version option and banner)
  - `setup.py`
  - `pyproject.toml`
  - `CHANGELOG.md`

### 4. **Testing**
- ✅ Tested `sipg search 'ssl:"Uber Technologies Inc"'` - Found 41 results
- ✅ Tested `sipg search 'ssl.cert.subject.CN:"*.uber.com"'` - Found 36 results
